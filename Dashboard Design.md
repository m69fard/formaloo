# Dashboard Design

## Data Transfer
The Appstore service will communicate data to the Dashboard service using a message queue like **RabbitMQ**. This ensures that data updates are processed asynchronously, reducing the load on the Appstore service while allowing real-time analytics.

## Data Aggregation
The Dashboard service will store aggregated data in a high-performance database. This will allow for efficient storage and querying of statistical data, such as:
- Number of apps created per day.
- Number of purchases per app.
- Verification trends over time.

### Database Choice:
- PostgreSQL if structured relational data and complex queries are needed.
- MongoDB if flexible, document-based storage is required.


## Scalability
To handle a large number of apps and users, the architecture will:
- Use **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** for high-throughput event streaming.
- Store aggregated data in **TimescaleDB** for fast analytics (a **PostgreSQL** extension for handling time-series data efficiently).
- Scale horizontally by deploying multiple instances of the Dashboard service behind a load balancer.
- Cache frequently accessed data using **Redis**.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Event Publishing**: The Appstore service will publish events (e.g., app creation, purchase, verification) to RabbitMQ.
2. **Event Processing**: A consumer in the Dashboard service will process these events and update the analytics database.
3. **Data Storage**: Aggregated data will be stored in database for reporting.
4. **API & UI**: A REST API will serve analytics data, which will be visualized in a frontend dashboard.
5. **Caching**: Redis will be used to cache frequently requested statistics.

This design ensures scalability, real-time analytics, and efficient querying for the Appstore service's Dashboard.
